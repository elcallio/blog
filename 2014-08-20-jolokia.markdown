## What's Jolokia?

JMX is "Java managability extensions". A standard technique/class lib for publishing metrics, operations etc.
The publishing is done by writing "MBeans" (managament beans) that along with regular methods have a lot of meta data
about itself and what it does. These are then published in the MBean server, an in-process entity that provides lookup and
connectivity.
The Java VM publishes a set of such MBeans about itself, and the same goes for most big Java apps (esp. J2EE servers and
web containers such as Tomcat).

The standard way to connect to the MBean server however, is via RMI (remote method invocation). Basically Java Corba.
The downside of this is obviously that its sort-of heavy weight as well as very Java specific.

Jolokia is instead a REST based connector to the MBean server, not entirely unlike the "JVM" section in the OSv REST Api, though much more extensive. It also comes with client connectors for several (web) languages and can be very smoothly integrated into
a jQuery or similar app.
