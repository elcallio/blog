[Spoiler: Its Tomcat]

[Capstan](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/capstan) is a tool for rapidly building and running applications on OSv.
Similar to Docker, Capstan users can download and run images from a public repository.
We chose to implemented Capstan repository using AWS S3


AWS S3  give us the flexibility and security needed, but by default missing a critical feature: download statistics.
This statistics are very interesting to us, to evaluate which of Capstan virtual appliances are more popular.


After a short tools survey, we choose [s3stat](http://www.s3stat.com/).


[s3stat](http://www.s3stat.com/) is a cloud base service which can follow you s3 bucket, and visualize download statistics, by file, country, browser day etc.
The price make sense, and it is super easy to enable.

So what are the results? (drums....)

![s3stat files](/images/s3stat_files.png)

Omitting Capstan download of capstan index.yaml files, which Capstan do for every repository search, the most popular images are the base images for OSv and OSv + Java.
That make sense because these two images will be used by anyone who want to build a local OSv application, running native or Java base app.


Virtual appliances comes right after, with (drums again....) **Tomcat**, **Cassandra**, **Memcached** on the podium (Tomcat is Gold).
These are all very early results, and probably does not mean much.
We will keep using s3stat to follow Capstan images downloads.
