Capstan is a tool for packing, shipping, and running applications in VMs Although at a very early phase, Capstan is already usable on Linux/KVM.

We have many plans for Capstan, here are few of them:

* Allow image manipulation, upload images to the repository
* Support repository search
* Port Capstan to Windows and Mac
* Support more HV, like VirtualBox, VMWare and cloud providers like EC2 and GCE
* Your idea hereâ€¦
