Blog posts must be stored in the source/_posts directory and named according to Jekyll's naming conventions: YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.markdown. The name of the file will be used as the url slug, and the date helps with file distinction and determines the sorting order for post loops.

Octopress provides a rake task to create new blog posts with the right naming conventions, with sensible yaml metadata.
