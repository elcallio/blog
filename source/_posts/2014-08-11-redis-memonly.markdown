[Redis](http://redis.io/) is a remarkably useful

Redis A to Z.  People on the Internet talk about Redis a lot, so here's what Google Suggest has to say about it...

Atomic, benchmark, cluster, delete, expire, failover, gem, hash, incr, Java, key, list, master/slave, node.js, objects, Python, queue, Ruby, set, ttl, Ubuntu, "vs. mongodb", Windows, XML, yum, zadd. 

Redis fills a valuable niche between memcached and a full-scale NoSQL database such as Cassandra.  Although it's fast and perfectly usable as a simple key-value store, you can also use Redis to manage more featureful data structures such as sets and queues.

It makes a great session cache, lightweight task queue, or a place to keep pre-rendered content or ephemeral data.
